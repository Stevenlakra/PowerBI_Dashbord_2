UPI TRANSACTION ANALYSIS _ POWER BI DASHBOARD PROJECT 2

1. Project Title / Headline
UPI Transactions: Digital Payments Insights Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze UPI transactions data for customer behavior, transaction trends, and banking performance.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The UPI Transactions Dashboard is a comprehensive and interactive Power BI report created to explore digital payment patterns across customers, banks, devices, and merchants. The dashboard highlights key insights such as transaction trends, remaining balances, customer age group behaviors, payment methods, and city-wise variations.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
•	Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for data visualization and report creation.
•	Power Query – Used for data cleaning, profiling, and transformation (splitting columns, adjusting data types, handling account numbers).
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Developed calculated measures (e.g., Age Groups) and applied dynamic logic for visuals.
•	Data Modeling – Established relationships and hierarchies (date, city, customer demographics).
•	File Format – .pbix for development and .png for report previews.

4. Data Source
Dataset of 20,000 UPI transactions containing fields such as Transaction ID, Date, Time, Amount, Banks (sender & receiver), Merchant details, Device type, Gender, Age, Payment Method, Transaction Status, and Remaining Balance.
This dataset enabled profiling, time-series trend analysis, and segmentation of customer and transaction patterns.

5. Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive Power BI tool that:
•	Provides insights into transaction success rates, volumes, and balances.
•	Tracks transaction trends across multiple time periods (monthly, yearly).
•	Highlights bank, city, and merchant-level variations in UPI adoption.
•	Segments customer behavior by age groups, gender, and device usage.
•	Enables comparison of different payment methods and transaction purposes.
